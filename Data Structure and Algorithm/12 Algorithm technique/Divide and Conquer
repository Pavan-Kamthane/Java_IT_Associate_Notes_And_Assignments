This technique involves breaking the problem into smaller parts, solving these smaller problems and then combining them to form the solution of the original problem.

It consists of the following steps:

Divide the original problem into sub-problems

Conquer or solve the sub-problems individually

Combine the solutions to get the solution for the original problem
